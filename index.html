    <h4> New School Canteen</h4>
    <img src="canteen.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider canteens must be better organized and more efficient than they have been in the past. online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. each student or staff member who accesses the canteen must be provided with a school canteen account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. ordering online by taking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all of us of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. here again, diversity is the key  </p>

    <h4> Implemented Online Attendance Managment System</h4>
    <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Implemented online attendance management system:  this informs parents about their child's /childrenâ€™s  activities in the school, instantly. once a student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text message. this helps schools keep a record of the students absences.  students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can be later checked by the Admin. the tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are a regular to the classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curricular subjects. as soon as you enter the students enrollment number or name, details like availability in class, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the trackers is supported by Cloud capabilities. even the security offered can be so robust and Powerful that those students who always fool their deans  are caught in a shorter span just after the admin enters login in details into their tracker. all this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner at reduced costs. </p>
